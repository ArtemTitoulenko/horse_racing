# HorseRacing

This is a horseracing simulation game. It came about after a network-wide wipe
of a common filesystem. We had a favored horseracing simulator which we forgot
to save, and it was lost in "the wipe".

This is an attempt at recreating that simulator.

Lessons learned:

  * It is kind of hard to make a CLI game
  * A game that is run by probabilities, but still has chance is really hard
  * Ruby is a formidable choice for curses programming
